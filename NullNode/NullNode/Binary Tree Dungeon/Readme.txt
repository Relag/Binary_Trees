This is part of a school project I made. The full project can be found here https://rejeanlagasse.carbonmade.com/projects/7182499, where there is a github link.

The game is a text-based RPG where the player must navigate randomly generated dungeons and fight enemies.

Included in this folder is the dungeon generation files.

Essentially it is a binary tree with a randomly determined depth and width. Each node has a room component, that randomly generates
enemies and items for the players.
